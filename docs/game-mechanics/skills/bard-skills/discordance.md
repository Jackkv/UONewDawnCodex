# Discordance

## Overview

Discordance will attract creatures to you and they will remain harmless until they reach you. Once they do, they will begin to attack again.

It will also reduce the creature skills and stats, and apply a bonus chance of success to other barding skills like Provocation.

To use Discordance, you need instruments and Musicianship to play them.

## Training

Train from Bard NPCs to reach around 30.

Discordance is a difficulty based skill. Some creatures are harder to "entice" than others, depending on their barding difficulty.

If you use Discordance on a peaceful creature, it won't attack you even once it reaches you. However, you can't use Discordance on a creature that has already been enticed.

To be more efficient, you can gain Discordance and Musicianship at the same time.
