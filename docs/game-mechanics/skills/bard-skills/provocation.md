# Provocation

## Overview

Provocation is one of the most powerful skills in the game, by using it you have a chance to make two creatures fight each other.

To use Provocation, you need instruments and Musicianship to play them.

## How it works

Provocation remembers the last instrument used. Use the skill, then target the two creatures you want to provoke.

If you fail, they will attack you instead.

If you succeed, the creatures will keep fighting each other as long as you are within a 30 tile range of the fight.

## Instruments

You can improve your chances of success by using Exceptional or Magical instruments.

## Training

Train from Bard NPCs to reach around 30.

Provocation is a difficulty based skill. Some creatures are harder to provoke than others, depending on their barding difficulty.

To be more efficient, you can gain Provocation and Musicianship at the same time.
