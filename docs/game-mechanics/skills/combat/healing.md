# Healing

## Overview

Healing must be paired with Anatomy to be effective, you can heal wounds, poison and even resurrect others with the use of bandages.

## Requirements

A minimum of 60 in both Healing and Anatomy will give you a 80% chance to cure poison.

A minimum of 80 in both Healing and Anatomy will give you a 25% chance of resurrecting others.

## Healing power

Anatomy directly affects the amount you can heal.

`Minimum amount = (Anatomy ÷ 5) + (Healing ÷ 5) + 3`

`Maximum amount = (Anatomy ÷ 5) + (Healing ÷ 2) + 10`

With both Healing and Anatomy at 100 for example, you could heal between 43 and 80 hit points.

## Bandages speed

This table shows the time in seconds that it takes for a bandage to be applied depending on your Dexterity.

    | 80        | 10s   |
    | 100       | 9s    |

=== "Others"

    | Dexterity   | Delay |
    |-------------|-------|
    | 25 or less  | 5s    |
    | 26 - 50     | 4.5   |
    | 51 - 79     | 4s    |
    | 81 - 99     | 3.5s  |
    | 100 or more | 3s    |

=== "Resurrect"

    | Dexterity   | Delay |
    |-------------|-------|
    | 25 or less  | 10s   |
    | 26 - 50     | 9.5   |
    | 51 - 79     | 9s    |
    | 81 - 99     | 8.5s  |
    | 100 or more | 8s    |

## Training

You will need to stockpile a large amount of cloth for your bandages.

Healing or curing others is faster than healing yourself, to be more efficient consider training two characters combat skill while healing each other.
