# SERVER PATCH 1.5

## February 25th, 2026

This patch continues to address bugs and behaviors reported by the community.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes & Adjustments

- The welcome gump will no longer pop up for accounts older than 7 days
- Veterinarians will resurrect your bonded pets if you say "help my pets"
- Fixed issue with transferring a bonded pet not reducing the number of bonded slots you have used
- The white wolf now spawns the nightfall wolf, instead of the grey wolf spawning both the nightfall and misty wolf
- Fixed issue with guards being able to be called on you after the 10 second timer expired
- When you initiate an attack, you will be revealed (and will attack)
- You can combine wands of the same kind. If, after a wand is combined and it has 0 charges left, it will delete itself.
- Fixed the fire breath damage on one of the Rift Masters, and fixed the issue with the Pirate Rift Master not attacking
- Added an achievement chain for discovering artifacts through archaeology
- Using a runebook with charges no longer requires the user to have magery
- Deteriorating pirate maps can be discovered twice in a 24 hour period, however added additional rare items to the fishing pool
- Artifact hunting now has achievements tied to them
- When you're in town or a house, tracking will work but reduced range. Previously, you couldn't track at all outside of the house or town region. For the full range based on your skill, move outside of those areas.

    > NOTE: Dungeon tracking is still dungeon region based (ie: you can't be in DungeonA, and pickup someone in DungeonB, or in DungeonA level 1 and pickup something in Dungeon level 2) with reduced range. However, if someone is standing on a Moongate or another POI region, and you are tracking from outside that region, you will have a normal chance to track them.

- Weapon accuracy now effects your chance to hit. Right now this only applies in PvM.

    > NOTE: These values can also now be adjusted in game to allow for refinement without needing additional patches, and/or can be enabled/disabled completely. The goal is to address the "whiff" warriors/dexxers are feeling swinging a weapon with GM skill. I'll continue to make tweaks and changes as feedback comes in.

## 🌀 Codex Bindings

The following notice has been posted outside the Illusion's Guild room in Moonglow:

> Travelers. You carry runebooks worn thin by the roads, and you have long sought a means to safeguard them against the misfortunes of this age. I have spent considerable time in study of the old bindings, those used by the war-scribes of a past era, and I believe I have found a way to replicate them. 
> Seek out the creatures that spill from the rifts. Hunt them, and follow the gates they leave behind into the wartime past. Within, you will find Codex Fragments, remnants of that era's knowledge, still potent. Gather enough of them, then come find me.
> I sell Arcane Ink for those with the coin to afford it. It is not cheap. The ingredients are not cheap. Do not haggle with me.
> With your gathered fragments and the Arcane Ink, seek a Grandmaster Alchemist. If you are not one yourself, find one you trust. They will know how to combine these materials into a Codex Binding. Apply it to your runebook, and it will be blessed.
> None of this will be easy. It is not meant to be.
> Signed, The Codex Scholar

Runebooks can now be permanently blessed by completing this process:

1. Collecting 25 codex fragments from rift encounters (random drop on the corpse of anything killed in there)
2. Purchasing Arcane Ink from the Codex Scholar (150,000 gp for the first purchase, with an increase of 50,000gp each purchase across all characters on that account)
3. Having a Grandmaster Alchemist craft a Codex Binding from the two sets of materials
4. Applying the finished binding to a runebook permanently blesses it

The entire process touches combat content through the rifts, the player economy through the scribe interaction and material trading, and the server's gold supply through the Arcane Ink purchase with increasing costs. The process is meant to be accessible to all players regardless of your play-style or time commitment.

## Healer Outposts

 > Commerce has consequences. The merchant guilds, pleased with the realm's growing prosperity, have lobbied successfully for healer outposts near the dungeon gates. The cynical will note that a dead adventurer spends no gold. The charitable will call it civic progress. Either way, you'll bleed out slightly less often.
