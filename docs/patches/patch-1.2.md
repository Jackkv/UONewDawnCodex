# SERVER PATCH 1.2

## February 13th, 2026

This patch continues to address any of the small bugs or behaviors people have been reporting. 🐛

- The amount of gold NPCs purchase weapons and armor was reduced last patch. However, it was also cutting the value of player crafted items. This has been reversed, and weapons and armor will be purchased 💰
- When you attack something, it will be more willing to come at you
- The champ completion message is now delayed ⏳
- Fixed the message sent to Discord when a champ is defeated 📢
- When you mark a rune, it will properly label it if the region has a name 🗺️
- Ghosts can no longer block recall rune spots
- At GM meditation, you have a 100% success rate 🧘
- Reactive armor buff icon properly gets removed
- Adjusted the combat cooldown on mounts from 20 seconds to 5 seconds 🐴
- Removed the *the music's hold weakens* messages 🎵
- You will no longer be flagged criminal if your pet or summon attacks a guild member
- Rift gates have a larger light circle and more visible hue
- Fixed the issue with the orc region and housing
- Fixed issue causing arrows to accumulate internally (should see a reduction in the item count by 25k+)
- Block the use of bank checks if your bank won't be able to hold all the gold piles
- Lowered the chance for the glacial staff to drop significantly

## 🎨 Charter Hue

A flaw in the dyeing process previously allowed the Charter Hue to be applied to bolts and large piles of cloth. This was never intended.

In the early New Dawn Era, scholars discovered a rare pigment that carried a faint residual essence from the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom itself. That essence bonds slowly and deliberately with individual garments, giving the Charter Hue its legendary depth. When spread recklessly across bulk cloth, the essence rejects the bond, and it slowly fades.

- All Charter Hue pigment previously applied to bolts and large cloth piles has now faded. Individually dyed garments remain unaffected
- Fixes the issue where some people didn't get bags if your account was created before 2/8/2026 at midnight. You should now get one when you log in
- Fixed the issue with the "limited" dye tub so that it now uses up the charges
- Limited dye tubs will show the hue number

## 🔪 Murder Changes

To address some initial feedback, the following changes were made:

- Long term kills will decay now every 48 hours, if you're under 5 long term kills. If you have 5+ long terms, you need to use a forged pardon 📜
- Short term kills will decay now every 24 hours (from 48) ⏰
- If your short term kills are under 5, short term kills decay every 16 hours
- If you have 5 or more kills and die in a dungeon, the lockout for that dungeon has been reduced from 15 to 5 minutes 🚪
- Stat/skill loss from short terms has been reduced from 20%–40% to 15%–25% 📉

NOTE: The numbers will continue to be tweaked and adjusted until they strike the right balance between consequence and playability

## 💘 Valentine's Day 2026

I'm not going to pretend I planned ahead on this one. Much like the rest of you today or tomorrow, I swung by the provisioner during lunch, grabbed whatever was near the front door, and threw it in a bag.

Though, each bag has some randomness to get something a bit more unique.
