# SERVER PATCH 1.15

## August 8th, 2026

This patch is a general maintainence patch that focuses on changes to the BOD system, introduces the Battle Mining inspired Battle Lumberjacking, with some bug fixes finish it off.

## 🛠️ Bug Fixes & Enhancements

- You can lead a horse to water, but it won't go on its own anymore (when you dismount, your horse won't wander off)
- Using emotes reveals you if hidden
- Fixed the incorrect graphic on the pirate reward cannon, and made them flippable
- Hides now cost 6gp from the vendor
- Oak logs are now the correct (darker) hue (existing oak logs won't change)
- Weapons crafted with runic hammers or runic dovetail saws now show the exceptional note and maker's mark
- A runic dovetail saw now crafts weapons like a runic hammer
- Crafting a fountain from the masonry crafting menu now gives you the fountain deed
- Newbied items can be auctioned
- Ship decay times increased to 14 days (applies on next refresh)
- Ships now decay like houses in all instances (previously, some IDOC boats wouldn't decay until a boat command was used)
- House decay times increased to 30 days (applies on next refresh)
- The IDOC warning window has been reduced from 2 hours to a base of 1 hour. If announced on Discord, a random amount of time, up to 45 minutes, gets subtracted from that base
- A water barrel can be sweetened with refined sugar (cooking BOD reward), giving bees a slight water boost
- A pollen patty (cooking BOD reward) can be applied to a hive to slightly boost the chances of better honey
- Dracothraxus gets announced in Discord 10 minutes after he spawns, while the in-dungeon notification still fires immediately
- Honey orders can now only be turned in at the beekeeper; the "Claim" button on the gump has been removed
- A new hue (Burnt Tangerine) was added as a champ reward for mask, runebook, and dragon dyes
- Potion kegs now change color based on what they're filled with. Single-click the keg and select "Clear" to remove the hue if you'd rather not
- Greater nightsight potions now fill kegs correctly
- Captain's telescopes are flippable
- The amount of material for dungeon dyes has been reduced to 100 from 250
- If a treasure chest is empty, you can single-click it to remove it
- The price of the wax crafting pot has been reduced by a large amount to account for it's limited use

## Battle Lumberjackin'

The forest isn't safe anymore. Like the miners and their gargoyle pickaxes, lumberjacks can now acquire a woodwarden's axe, which gives you a chance to pull up an Oak Reaper, Ash Reaper, Yew Reaper, or the rare Tree Giant. Combine it with some heartwood oil to boost your trees and increase the wood type and reaper difficulty. Keep an eye out for some new statues as well.

## Capture the Flag

These are just a few small changes, with some additional changes around scoring, flag hold times, etc coming in the future.

- Any stray CTF flags get removed before a new game starts
- The Scallywags and Scoundrels have new team colors
- Team colors no longer change the hue of your whole character. Instead, the aura under your feet reflects your team color (make sure it's enabled in your client), and the flag carrier gets a unique color so they're easy to spot

## Bulk Order Deeds

- Updated the tailoring 450 BOD rewards
- Updated the labels on small and large BODs
- Fixed the carpentry accept BOD gumps so they correctly show special requirements (fixes a missing cliloc error)
- You can now single-click a container in your bag to attempt to combine all the items inside it
- Sturdy dovetail saws now have 180 charges instead of a random number between 25-75
- Reworked all carpentry and cooking BOD rewards so smaller BODs give consumable rewards, and moved deco items to the large BOD reward pool
- BOD Books will display the item type name (so instead of "crate" it will say "LargeCrate" or "SmallCrate")

The [tailoring](../skills/crafting/tailoring.md), [cooking](../skills/crafting/cooking.md), and [carpentry](../skills/crafting/carpentry.md) pages have been updated to reflect the reward changes.
