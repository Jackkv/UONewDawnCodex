### Bug Fixes & Adjustments

- **Interior Double Doors:** Placing a new house with interior double-doors will no longer link them together -- opening one will not open the other. If you have an existing house and would like this behavior removed, let me know
- **Sin Tracking:** The "I must consider my sins" message will now correctly display your long-term murder count expiration
- **Pet Transfers:** You must now meet the minimum taming skill requirement of a pet in order to accept a transfer of it

- **Ocllo Sewers:** Young players will now be able to enter the Ocllo Sewers even if another character on the same account is already inside the dungeon
- **Fishing:** Adjusted the chances of fishing up ancient sea serpents and artifact clues
- **Skill Gain Curve:** Adjusted the gain rate for skills approaching the 100.0 individual cap while also nearing the 700 total skill cap. This should balance out what I was looking for gain wise
- **Stats Gain:** Adjusted stats gains so they feel _a little_ faster
- **Runebook Rune Ordering:** You can no longer reorder runes inside a runebook while it is locked down

- **Anatomy:** Now has a 1-second cooldown between uses
- **Magic Reflect:** At GM Magery with no Inscription, Magic Reflect will now absorb up to 8 circles of spells (down from 11). With 100.0 Magery and 100.0 Inscription, it will absorb up to 15
- **Vendor Menus:** The single-click buy/sell context menu on vendors now requires you to be within 4 tiles (down from 8), matching the range of the standard vendor buy interaction
- **Line of Sight:** Attempting to cast a spell on a target not in your line of sight will now display a "target cannot be seen" message and drop the cursor appropriately
- **Repair Deeds:** Fixed a mislabeled description on repair deeds. Additionally, newly created repair deeds are no longer blessed
- **Animal Lore:** The Animal Lore gump will now display the total number of owners an animal has had on the top
- **Loot Tables:** Hats have been removed from the random magic drop pool that generates weapons, armor, and jewelry

😈Champions of Evil

I'm continuing to tune champion spawns so they strike a balance between challenge and reward. Right now the scales tip too far toward reward without enough risk to match when it comes to some of the champs, so these changes pull things back toward center.

- The amount of gold dropped per splash pile now scales based on the tier of the champion spawn -- earlier tiers yield less, later tiers yield more
- The total gold generated across all champion spawn creatures has been reduced by half
- The Barracoon champ platform has been restored
- Barracoon can now trigger The Piper's Call, a haunting melody that drawing victims close to him

📜Name Changes

The Court of Truth in Yew has opened its ledgers to those seeking a fresh start. The court clerk -- a fastidious woman with ink-stained fingers and little patience for indecision -- will hear your request, provided your coin purse is heavy enough and your record is clean... enough.

- Approach the clerk and say **"I request a name change"**
- If you have not changed your name within the last 14 days and carry sufficient funds, **200,000 gold** will be deducted from your bank box **right away** and you will be presented with the name change gump
- Your first name change will be free
- You will be frozen in place until you select a valid name

🪙The Scales Tip in Magincia

Whispers have spread through every dockside tavern from Ocllo to Paws that there's judge from Yew who hangs out in Bucs Den whose sense of justice bends with the weight of coin. You'll usually find him at The Pirate's Blunder, if you can stomach the company he keeps. He asks no questions. He never has.

But take heed. The nobles of Magincia have grown tired of watching murderers walk free. Gold has been flowing into the courts to see this corruption unraveled, and the judge, ever aware of the noose tightening around his neck, has raised his prices accordingly. Redemption, it seems, does not come cheap.

- **Pardons now start at 150,000 gold**. Each subsequent pardon doubles in cost -- 300k for a second, 600k for a third. After that, the judge won't help you. You're on your own.
- The judge will now entertain requests from those with up to 20 murders on their record (up from 10). Beyond that, even he won't go near you
- You may now purchase a pardon if you carry at least 1 long-term murder count (used to be 5)
- The pardon is blessed. Carry it with you. If you die and resurrect with it in your pack, it will be consumed automatically. Stat loss will be avoided, and both your short-term and long-term murder counts will be reset to zero.
- If you are alive, you may simply double-click the pardon to consume it and receive the same benefit

📢A word of advice from the judge himself: Purchase your pardon before you need it. You never know when the executioner comes calling -- and he does not sell to the dead.

🧌Trolls Reemerge

For years the deep caves and mountain passes of Britannia sat quiet -- unsettlingly so. Travelers moved freely through highland roads that their grandfathers would never have dared walk unarmed before the Codex war. The old-timers muttered that it wouldn't last, that the trolls hadn't gone, only retreated. They were right.

As the citizens of New Dawn have begun building homesteads and laying roots across the land, the disturbance has drawn ancient attention. Cave trolls have been spotted lurking in the deeper reaches of Britannia's caverns, and mountain trolls have returned to the high passes and rocky ridgelines in force. Whether they've been driven out by something deeper underground or simply drawn to the scent of civilization is anyone's guess.

The local town councils have issued warnings: avoid dark caves and mountain passes when possible, and never travel alone.
