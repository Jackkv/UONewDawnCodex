# The World of New Dawn

Explore the vast realm of Britannia and discover its many wonders.

## Introduction: New Dawn

In the sprawling multiverse of Ultima Online, a new chapter begins. Welcome to **New Dawn**, a realm where ancient lore collides with rising darkness, set against the rich history of Britannia.

Drawing inspiration from Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny and Ultima VI: The False Prophet, New Dawn carries forward the legacy of those legendary tales. The landscapes and towns you'll explore bear the marks of past triumphs and old conflicts.

But before we look forward, we must look back.

The Codex War defined an era. For twenty-five brutal years, gargoyles, orcish hordes, undead abominations, and cunning pirates tore Britannia apart in their struggle to claim the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This repository of unparalleled knowledge became an obsession worth killing for, and the land paid dearly. Cities fell. Families were torn apart. Entire generations knew nothing but conflict.

Then the Avatar rose to end it. Guided by the wisdom of the Codex itself, the Avatar led a final charge to reclaim Castle Britannia and drive the gargoyles back to their mysterious realm. But victory demanded sacrifice. To ensure the Codex could never again become a weapon, the Avatar destroyed it, an act that changed Britannia's destiny forever.

A century has passed since then.

The world has slowly mended. The people of Britannia, stubborn and resilient as ever, have rebuilt their shattered lives. Towns have transformed, some rising from ashes, others growing where none stood before. This period of recovery and renewal has come to be known as the New Dawn Era.

Still, not everyone rests easy. The gargoyles were banished, not defeated, and the elders haven't forgotten. A dedicated order called the Guardians of the Realm maintains constant vigil over the entrance to the gargoyle realm, their watchfulness the only thing standing between Britannia and whatever might still lurk on the other side.

Welcome to New Dawn. Adventure awaits those willing to seek it, and the promise of a new chapter belongs to anyone brave enough to write it.
