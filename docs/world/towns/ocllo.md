# Ocllo: Fortified by Vision and Resilience

In the months preceding the relentless gargoyle invasion, a harbinger of fate emerged in the form of Penumbra, known as the Daughter of the Eclipse. She graced the shores of Ocllo with a forewarning of the impending doom. Moved by her words, the City Council of Ocllo swiftly took action, approving a crucial measure that would alter the city's destiny.

With unwavering determination, Ocllo's citizens embarked on an ambitious endeavor to fortify their beloved city. Drawing upon their mastery of stonework, metalworking, and weapon craftsmanship, they united their skills to construct a formidable wall, shielding a vital portion of the city from the encroaching threat. Moreover, to deny the gargoyle invaders easy access, they made the bold decision to destroy the narrow river that once granted passage to small ships across the salt lake.

Ocllo's artisans and farmers, renowned for their expertise, worked tirelessly to establish a robust infrastructure capable of withstanding the looming storm. The city transformed into a bastion of resilience and preparedness, brimming with defensive fortifications and the resolute spirit of its inhabitants.

As the gargoyle invasion engulfed Britannia, Ocllo stood as a shining example of vision and unity. The foresight of Penumbra and the resolute actions of the City Council had safeguarded the city against the imminent threat. Walls now encircled Ocllo, shielding it from harm, while the destruction of the river thwarted the enemy's advancements.

Ocllo's unwavering resolve and mastery of various trades ensured its survival in the face of adversity. The citizens' dedication to their craft, coupled with their prowess in weapon-making and agricultural pursuits, forged a formidable stronghold amidst the chaos.
