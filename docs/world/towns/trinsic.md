# Trinsic: Honor Reforged

Before the war, Trinsic stood as one of Britannia's proudest cities, its battlements guarding a jewel of civilization along the southern coast. The town was built on honor, and its people lived by that virtue in everything they did.

When the invasion came, Trinsic refused to break. Its walls held against wave after wave of attackers through sheer discipline and strength of will. Paladins fought alongside common folk, shield to shield, determined to prevail or die trying. For a time, it seemed the city might actually survive the war intact.

It did not. The siege that finally broke Trinsic was long and brutal, and when the walls fell, the destruction was thorough. But the enemy could only tear down stone. They could not touch what made Trinsic what it was.

The survivors regrouped among the rubble. Led by veterans who had carved their names into legend during the defense, they refused to abandon their home. Where others might have scattered, the people of Trinsic stayed and began rebuilding from the ashes, the same honor that had held the walls now holding the community together.

A century later, Trinsic endures, though only partially restored. The southwestern quarter has been reclaimed, its streets bustling once again with trade and daily life. But venture beyond that corner and you find the old city as the war left it. Hollowed out houses stand open to the sky, their walls crumbling and their hearths cold. Entire districts remain abandoned, too damaged or too haunted by memory for anyone to rebuild. The contrast is stark, life and ruin separated by little more than a street.

Perhaps someday Trinsic will reclaim the rest of what was lost. For now, the southwestern quarter carries the city's legacy forward, proof that honor survives even when the walls do not.
