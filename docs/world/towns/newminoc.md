# New Minoc: A Haven Within Crescent Mountain

Upon receiving dire tidings of the Invasion of Cove, the inhabitants of Minoc wasted no time in fleeing their ancestral homes. Seeking safety and solace, they embarked on an exodus towards the protective embrace of Crescent Mountain, a majestic peak nestled in the northern reaches. Abandoning the desolate streets of Minoc, they left behind a ghost town, devoid of life.

Unbeknownst to the relentless gargoyles, who pursued their conquest with unwavering determination, Minoc had become an empty shell. Mistakenly believing that the fleeing populace sought refuge in Windemere Wood or embarked on perilous voyages across the treacherous waters of Lost Hope Bay, the gargoyles cast their gaze eastward, beyond the towering summit of Mount Kendall.

Meanwhile, the resilient citizens of Minoc found sanctuary within the rugged confines of Crescent Mountain. Fueled by unwavering determination and blessed with abundant reserves of valuable ores and sparkling gemstones, they deftly constructed new dwellings and trading establishments within the very heart of the mountain's protective embrace. This secluded haven, born from their resourcefulness, came to be known as New Minoc, a testament to their resilience and their yearning to withdraw from the tumultuous realms of Britannia.

Within the sheltered sanctuary of New Minoc, the people forged a solemn pledge to carve their own path, far removed from the chaotic tides that swept across the land. Embracing their newfound community, they pledged to chart a destiny steeped in self-determination and free from the external pressures that had plagued their former home. As the resolute inhabitants of New Minoc harnessed the rich resources of Crescent Mountain, they etched their mark upon the pages of history, a testament to their strength and unwavering spirit.
