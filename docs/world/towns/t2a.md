# Delucia and Papua: Sealed Realms of Britannia's Lost Souls

In the dire days of Britannia's invasion, when chaos and terror plagued the land, Delucia and Papua emerged as havens of refuge for countless fleeing citizens. As the relentless storm of war raged on, these two towns provided sanctuary to those desperately seeking safety. However, the fates of Delucia and Papua took an unforeseen turn when the Avatar, in a moment of profound sacrifice, shattered the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.

With the destruction of the Codex, a cataclysmic event rippled through the realms, rending the very fabric of magic. The enchantment granted by the Armageddon spell, which once granted access to the enigmatic realm of The Lost Lands, vanished without a trace. This sudden disappearance left Delucia and Papua severed from the mystic energies that bound them to that ethereal plane.

No longer were there known Followers of Armageddon capable of casting the spell and venturing into The Lost Lands to attempt their rescue. The inhabitants of Delucia and Papua were left in a state of uncertainty, their destiny cast into the shadows, their ultimate fate obscured from the eyes of the world.

To this day, the unknown lingers over Delucia and Papua, cloaking their existence in an enigmatic shroud. The towns stand as silent testaments to the mysteries that unfold when the threads of magic are severed. The current state and well-being of those who sought solace within their protective walls remain an enigma, their stories lost in the annals of time.

Legends and speculations circulate, passed down through whispers and fragmented accounts. Some speak of these towns as ethereal sanctuaries, existing within a realm unseen, untouched by the mortal world. Others weave tales of their inhabitants being trapped within an uncharted dimension, forever separated from the realm of Britannia.

Delucia and Papua now stand as ethereal vestiges, their streets and structures veiled in the mists of the unknown. Their fate serves as a stark reminder of the consequences that accompany the destruction of ancient wisdom and the disruption of sacred magic. As time flows onward, the destiny of those in Delucia and Papua remains a lingering question mark, waiting to be unraveled by the curious minds daring enough to venture into the realms of uncertainty and seek the truth that lies within.
