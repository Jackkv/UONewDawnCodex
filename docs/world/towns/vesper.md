# Vesper: The Sunken Sanctuary

Before the war, Vesper was a thriving sea town, its fertile shores and island streets home to merchants, fishermen, and families who built their lives around the harbor. When word of the invasion spread, most residents fled westward, hoping to find safety deeper inland. Those who stayed behind prepared for siege, fortifying what they could and bracing for the fight to come.

None of them expected what actually happened.

As the conflict spread across Britannia, the enemy turned their attention to Vesper. Rather than take the town by conventional assault, they planted explosives deep beneath the island's foundations. The underwater blasts tore through bedrock and support alike, and Vesper simply dropped into the sea. The town's last defenders never had a chance to fight. They drowned at their posts as the streets collapsed beneath them, pulled down into the churning water along with everything they had sworn to protect.

A century later, the world above has changed as much as the ruins below. Ice and snow now blanket the region where Vesper once enjoyed mild coastal weather. The waters have grown cold and unforgiving, and winter never quite releases its grip on this part of Britannia.

But life has returned to Vesper, after a fashion. A small fishing village now sits along the shore, built by settlers determined to reclaim something from the tragedy. It bears the same name but little resemblance to the bustling trade hub of old. The population is modest, the buildings practical, the atmosphere quiet. To the south, the Vesper Outpost keeps watch over the surrounding waters, serving as both a waystation for travelers and a reminder that this region still demands vigilance.

Beneath the frozen surface, the old Vesper remains. Crumbling walls and broken bridges stand in the murky depths, silent monuments to everyone who couldn't escape. Explorers have braved those frigid waters over the years, swimming through flooded corridors in search of artifacts and forgotten knowledge. They report an eerie beauty in the ruins, treasure mixed with tragedy at every turn. But they also speak of something else, a presence in those lightless halls that makes even hardened divers uneasy.

The sunken city's gates remain open to anyone bold enough to enter. What secrets old Vesper still guards, and what spirits might linger in its frozen depths, only the sea knows for certain.
