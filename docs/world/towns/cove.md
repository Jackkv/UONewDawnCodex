# Cove: The Betrayal and the Orcish Conquest

Cove, once a flourishing settlement nestled within the protective embrace of a majestic mountain range, fell victim to treachery and a devastating orcish invasion during the early days of the gargoyles' onslaught.

Unbeknownst to the unsuspecting citizens of Cove, a grave betrayal unfolded behind the scenes. While the town boasted a formidable wooden fortress wall that seemed impenetrable to frontal attacks, a sinister alliance had formed between the orcs and the gargoyles. Veiled beneath the cover of darkness, the orcs clandestinely burrowed through the very heart of the mountain that had long shielded Cove from their neighboring orc stronghold.

As the orcs methodically tunneled their way towards Cove, a relentless force of their brethren stood guard at the town's front gates, mercilessly cutting down any unfortunate soul who dared attempt an escape. Trapped within the confines of their once safe haven, the inhabitants of Cove faced a grim fate. Every captive they took was ruthlessly slain, and the town soon fell under the complete control of the invading orcish horde.

In the aftermath of the devastating attack, the truth behind the orchestrated betrayal gradually came to light. Queen Zhah, the enigmatic ruler of the gargoyles who had been presumed deceased, emerged as the orchestrator of this initial assault. Her involvement in the fall of Cove sent shockwaves through Britannia, as tales of her malevolence spread among those who survived.

Presently, cautionary whispers circulate throughout the land, warning travelers to steer clear of the accursed region once known as Cove. The town now stands as a grim reminder of the orcish infestation that permeates its every corner. The once vibrant streets and bustling marketplaces have fallen into a state of ruin and desolation. The air hangs heavy with an atmosphere of fear and hostility, as the orcs maintain a firm grip on their newly conquered territory.

Cove serves as a stark testament to the perils that lurk within Britannia's borders. Its scarred landscape and haunted streets stand as a grim reminder of the fragility of trust and the depths of betrayal. As the orcs maintain their ironclad control over the fallen town, it stands as a place to be avoided, a chilling testament to the consequences of treachery and the ever-present threat of the orcish menace.
