From a city under siege to an emblem of freedom, Serpent's Hold embodies the triumph of a united community's spirit. It stands as a resilient sanctuary, an unyielding testament to the valor of its defenders and the collective will to forge a future on their own terms.

Today, Serpent's Hold stands as a beacon of defiance, etching its legacy deep into the tapestry of Britannian history. Its quest for independence continues to inspire generations, reminding them that even in the face of overwhelming odds, the indomitable human spirit can prevail.
