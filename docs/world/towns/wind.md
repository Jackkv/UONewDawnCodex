## Wind - The Sealed Sanctum

As war's dark tide approached Britannia's shores, the reclusive mages of Wind took drastic steps to protect their isolated sanctuary. Already wary of outsiders, Wind's elders invoked powerful magics to seal off access to their mountainous domain.

Behind newly fortified walls and illusory veils, Wind's residents carried on their scholarly pursuits undisturbed by the chaos engulfing surrounding lands. Supplies were rationed and rituals focused on maintaining the etheric barriers securing their community against invasion.

Throughout seasons when other cities fell to fire and steel, Wind remained untouched, its existence all but faded from memory. Only when the Avatar at last triumphed did its mages reluctantly emerge, finding a world nearly unrecognizable from the era they had secluded themselves against.

To this day Wind endures in solitude, its entrance a puzzle that few can discern. Its people walk tranquilly through days and nights focused inward, indifferent to the lands below that have renewed themselves over long generations. Within their timeless halls, it is whispered secrets lay protected that the outside world must never know.
