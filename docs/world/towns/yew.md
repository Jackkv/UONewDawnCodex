# Yew: Rebirth Among the Trees

When war swept through Yew, nature wasted no time reclaiming what remained. The ancient yew trees for which the settlement was named spread their roots through the rubble, their branches soon obscuring all signs of the town that once stood there. Within a generation, the forest had swallowed old Yew entirely.

The displaced residents fled to Yew Abbey, rallying behind its fortified walls as battles raged across Britannia. What began as temporary shelter became permanent home. For generations after the Avatar's victory, the people of Yew lived among the monastery grounds, building a makeshift community around the Abbey's stone halls. Over time, this refuge grew into the new heart of Yew itself, much as Britain Castle became the center of its own rebuilt city.

As order gradually returned to the land, some effort was made to reclaim the ancestral settlement. The old jail and courthouse were restored, standing once again as symbols of justice and law. But the surrounding woods had changed during the long years of abandonment. Druids and mystics had made the forest their own, and they had no intention of giving it back.

Tensions between Yew's settlers and the forest dwellers eventually reached a breaking point. The druids united under a figure called Lord Oaks, who now claims absolute authority over the woodlands. Backed by primal magics and an unwavering belief in his cause, he enforces his will without mercy. The old Yew forest belongs to him now, and he guards it jealously against any who would clear its trees or tame its wild places.

The rebuilt Yew survives, centered around the Abbey and managing the surrounding farmlands and pastures. Its people remember what their town once was, and they hold onto hope that someday the full vision of Yew might be restored. But for now, Lord Oaks and his followers stand between them and their ancestral home.
