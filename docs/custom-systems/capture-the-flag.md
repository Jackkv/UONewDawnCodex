# Capture the Flag

Capture the Flag (CTF) is New Dawn's team-based PvP mode. Two teams of pirates race to steal the enemy flag and bring it back to their base, while defending their own flag from being taken.

## Sign up

You can sign up in the Dawn Event Center, coordinates 5225, 387.

The Dawn Event Center can be accessed by using any public moongate and selecting the upper right option.

After both teams reach the arena minimum player requirement, the match will start after one minute.

## Game rules

- Full PvP is enabled between opposing teams - friendly fire is not
- No mounts allowed
- No pets or followers may enter the arena
- Stealing skill is disabled
- Summoning spells are blocked
- Skill and stat gains do not occur during matches
- Killing yourself awards no points
- Potions, reagents, and other consumables are free - nothing is consumed inside the arena
- Clothing take no damage
- When you die your items will be reequipped on resurrection
- Explosion pots have an 8 second timer
- The aura under your feet reflects your team color (make sure it's enabled in your client) and the flag carrier gets a unique color so they're easy to spot
- Individual player stats are tracked and recorded at the end of the game. Total points, total damage, flags captured, flags returned, flags stolen, flag carriers killed, players killed, number of deaths, and deaths while guarding the base

### Winning conditions

- The game ends when one team has scored 3 captures, or after 20 minutes
- After 20 minutes, the team with the most flag captures wins
- If the teams have the same number of captures (tie) at the end of 20 minutes, the team with the most points will be declared the winner

## Flag Mechanics

- If both flags are being carried, neither team can complete a capture
- When a flag is dropped, it will automatically return to home base in 5 seconds. Another player can pick up the flag during this time.

### Stealing the Flag

Double-click the enemy flag at their base to steal it. The flag will be placed in your backpack.

- You cannot hide or stealth while carrying the flag
- You have a carry-time countdown before being forced to capture or be killed:
  - First pickup: 120 seconds
  - Each subsequent relay pickup (picking up a flag that was already stolen and dropped) reduces the timer by 30 seconds, down to a minimum of 15 seconds
- Countdown warnings are sent at 60, 30, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 seconds remaining
- If the timer hits zero, you are killed and the flag is returned home automatically

### Returning your Flag

If the enemy has stolen your flag, walk up to it (wherever it has been dropped or left on the ground) and double-click it to return it home. You earn 4 points for a return, subject to a 60-second cooldown to prevent farming.

### Dropping the Flag

You can manually drop the flag by using it on yourself. After dropping:

- You cannot pick it back up for 5 seconds
- Your remaining carry time is clamped to at most 5 seconds - you can't drop-and-pickup to reset the clock

If you are killed while carrying the flag, it drops at your location. Any player (enemy or ally) can pick it up from the ground.

### Capturing the Flag

To score a capture:

1. Steal the enemy flag and bring it to your own flag base
2. Stand next your own flag base to capture

After a successful capture:

- Both flags are reset to their home bases
- A 20-second lock prevents either flag from being picked up (with countdown announcements)
- All living players are returned to their team's starting positions

## Arenas

Both arenas are pirate-themed.

### Pirate Treasure Island

> _The Battle for Treasure Island_

- Minimum 3 players per team to start
- Maximum 10 players per team
- Island-themed battleground with multiple pathways between bases

### Pirate Shipwreck Arena

> _The Battle for Survival_

- Minimum 5 players per team to start
- Maximum 10 players per team
- Shipwreck-themed map with long bridge battles

## Scoring

Points are awarded to individual players throughout the match. Team victory is determined by captures, but individual points feed into War Token rewards and tiebreakers.

!!! note
    Flag steals are tracked as a stat but award no direct points on their own - the points come when you successfully capture.

## War Tokens

War Tokens are the currency earned through CTF matches. They can be exchanged for [rewards](../game-mechanics/currencies.md#war-tokens-store) at the [Dawn Event Center](../game-mechanics/currencies.md#dawn-event-center).

At the end of a game, tokens are awarded based on your individual points for that match:

- Winners receive their total points plus a +5 win bonus
- Losers receive their total points only
- There is a daily cap of 150 War Tokens per player - once hit, stats still record but no further tokens are awarded until the next day (Central Time)

Check your balance at any time with the `[profile` command.
