# Achievement System

Track your accomplishments and earn rewards through New Dawn's comprehensive Achievement system. Complete challenges, reach milestones, and unlock exclusive titles and items as you explore and master different aspects of the game.

## Overview

The Achievement system was completely rewritten in Patch 1.0 to provide a robust point-based progression system with meaningful rewards. Achievements cover various gameplay aspects including discovery, hunting, crafting, PvP, and more.

Whether you're an explorer, fighter, crafter, or completionist, the achievement system offers long-term goals and tangible rewards for your efforts.
